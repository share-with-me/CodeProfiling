# CodeProfiling
This project focuses on the use of various tools such as gprof, sysprof, valgrind, kcachegrind in order to profile codes. The performance metrics help in analysing the execution of a program. We then make
use of various security vulnerablity exploitation tools such as flawfinder, RATS, splint in order to find out the security sensitive parts of a code.
With the help of ROP gadgets, we then secure these vulnerabailies by embedding other security codes in the cold parts of the program (which were obtained via profiling).
This results in maximal security of codes with minimal performance overhead.
